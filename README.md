# Financial-Statistics-Report-2024
This report provides an analysis of taxation using statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and regression modeling. The objective is to uncover income patterns, tax deduction behaviors, and demographic trends to provide insight that can inform financial strategies and policy decisions

This repository contains a comprehensive **Financial Statistics Report** developed by **Ba Viet Anh (Henry) Nguyen**. The project applies various statistical methods to analyze taxation data, uncover trends, and derive insights related to income patterns, tax deduction behaviors, and demographic factors. It combines Python programming for statistical analysis with Excel-based visualizations to provide actionable insights for financial strategies and policymaking.

## Project Overview

This report analyzes a dataset of **1,000 randomly selected tax lodgments** out of 258,774 entries. Key objectives include:
- Identifying gender-based income disparities.
- Evaluating the financial advantages of professional tax preparation services.
- Exploring relationships between age, income, deductions, and other demographic variables.
- Delivering insights to support equitable financial planning and tax policies.

Statistical techniques such as **descriptive statistics**, **confidence intervals**, **hypothesis testing**, and **regression modeling** are employed to derive meaningful conclusions.
